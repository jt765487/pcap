[Directories]
# These are the folders the service will use.
# Ensure these directories exist and the service has permission to read/write.

# Source directory where the external application writes .pcap files
source_dir = /var/tmp/MOVE/src

# Working directory for files being processed or awaiting upload
work_dir = /var/tmp/MOVE/work

# Directory containing the CSV manifest file (e.g., SHA256-HASH.csv)
csv_dir = /var/tmp/MOVE/csv

# Directory for successfully uploaded files
done_dir = /var/tmp/MOVE/done

# Directory for files that failed critical move operations (e.g., couldn't be moved to work_dir or done_dir)
failed_move_dir = /var/tmp/MOVE/failed_move

# Directory for files that failed upload permanently (e.g., server rejected them, non-network errors)
dead_letter_dir = /var/tmp/MOVE/dead_letter

[Files]
# Name of the CSV manifest file located in 'csv_dir'
csv_filename = SHA256-HASH.csv

[Network]
# Settings for connecting to the remote server.

# Full URL of the remote endpoint for uploading PCAP files
# Example: http://your-server-address:port/path
remote_host_url = http://192.168.0.180:8989/pcap

# How long (in seconds) to wait for the server to respond during upload
request_timeout = 20

# IMPORTANT: Set this to 'true' if using HTTPS (https://...) AND the server has a valid SSL certificate.
# Setting to 'false' disables certificate checking (less secure, use only for testing or specific internal networks).
verify_ssl = false

[Timing]
# Controls how often tasks run and how long to wait for retries.

# How often (in seconds) to scan the work directory for files to upload
work_dir_poll_interval = 5

# Initial delay (in seconds) before retrying a failed network connection/upload
initial_backoff = 1

# Maximum delay (in seconds) between network retries (prevents excessively long waits)
max_backoff = 60

# Delay (in seconds) between retrying a failed file move operation
move_retry_delay = 1

[Retries]
# Controls how many times certain operations are attempted.

# Maximum number of attempts for critical file moves (e.g., src->work, work->done)
move_max_retries = 3

# Maximum attempts to generate a unique filename if a file with the same name already exists in the destination
max_collision_attempts = 1000

[Logging]
# Controls the level of detail in the logs.
# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
#   INFO: Default, shows normal operations.
#   DEBUG: Very detailed, for troubleshooting.
#   WARNING: Shows potential issues or handled errors.
log_level = INFO
